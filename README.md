# Speech Recognition App


## How It's Made:
I will be re-doing this at some point.
For this app I leveraged the Speech Recognition global variable, that lives on top of the browser. The idea was to leverage the various properties of the speech recognition app to view and append the transcript that it returns as the user speaks into her computer microphone. However the app needs to be run through some sort of server as it cannot run through a static file. 

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Installation:
1. Clone this repo
2. Install with npm install
3. Run server with node server.js

## It supports multiple languages & Also FREE to use :)
